This notebook delves into two main programming tasks:

Gradient Descent Exploration: Visualize and implement the gradient descent algorithm to minimize a complex mathematical function, including hand-calculated gradients and iterative updates visualized on a contour plot.
Housing Price Regression: Utilize linear regression to predict housing prices based on house features. Perform regression using only NumPy, visualize cost functions, and experiment with gradient descent parameters. Compare analytical and computational approaches to finding regression weights.
