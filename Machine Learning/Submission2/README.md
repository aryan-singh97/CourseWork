This notebook focuses on predicting the popularity of songs using logistic regression. Utilizing datasets train-songs.csv and test-songs.csv, which include various audio properties from tracks on Spotify, the task involves:

Implementing the loss function and gradient for the logistic regression model.
Training the model using gradient descent.
Evaluating performance with a confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score at a threshold of 0.4, and plotting the ROC curve.
Comparing three simplified logistic regression models using subsets of features to determine the best performance via the AUC metric.
